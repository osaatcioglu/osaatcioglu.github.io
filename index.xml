      <title>Hugo Static Site Generator</title>

      <description>I was looking for a static site generator that can work nicely with github pages. And, I came across to Hugo
It takes a bit of time to understand the template (if you don&amp;rsquo;t know go already, I don&amp;rsquo;t) and how to publish a content. But, once you are there, the rest is quite trivial.
I have also written a small script that keeps the generated files in the master branch while the source branch has all the raw files needed by Hugo.</description>

      <description>I tried to write about tech and related stuff several times in different platforms. But, life got in the way and I didn&amp;rsquo;t continue. I wonder how many times I used this typical &amp;ldquo;Hello World!&amp;rdquo; post. Yet, here I am.
Failing is OK. One can still learn along the way. So, I want to try more regardless if it fails. And while I am busy with trying, I hope that my humble experience reaches to some and it gets useful.</description>

      <description> Compiler written in Python interpreting LISP like language
The purpose of the project is to show how to parse, interpret and evaluate the abstract syntax tree.
 A django project consumes booli.se data and list the realty prices
I created this project while I was searching for an apartment. I used this tool to get a price overview of the neighbourhood that I was looking.
