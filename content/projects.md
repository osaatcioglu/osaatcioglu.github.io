- [Compiler written in Python interpreting LISP like language](https://github.com/osaatcioglu/Lisp-esque-language)

	The purpose of the project is to show how to parse, interpret and evaluate the abstract syntax tree.

- [A django project consumes booli.se data and list the realty prices](https://github.com/osaatcioglu/booliwood)

	I created this project while I was searching for an apartment. I used this tool to get a price overview of the neighbourhood that I was looking.
