I was looking for a static site generator that can work nicely with github pages. And, I came across to [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo)

It takes a bit of time to understand the template (if you don't know go already, I don't) and how to publish a content. But, once you are there, the rest is quite trivial.

I have also written a small script that keeps the generated files in the master branch while the source branch has all the raw files needed by Hugo. You can check [the script](https://github.com/osaatcioglu/osaatcioglu.github.io/blob/source/publish.sh).

Thanks to Hugo, now I can write my blog posts in Markdown and push it to the repo to show them to the world with my own taste of UI.
