I recently developed a very simple CLI app to send WhatsApp messages directly from CLI. It was a nice experience as I learned how to use Puppeteer which is a headless Chrome with Node APIs. Also, I learned how to package and publish Node Packages.

It is not very fancy but I am using it from time to time. Check out the repo at [https://github.com/osaatcioglu/whatsapp-cli](https://github.com/osaatcioglu/whatsapp-cli)
