I tried to write about tech and related stuff several times in different platforms. But, life got in the way and I didn't continue. I wonder how many times I used this typical "Hello World!" post. Yet, here I am.

Failing is OK. One can still learn along the way. So, I want to try more regardless if it fails. And while I am busy with trying, I hope that my humble experience reaches to some and it gets useful.

Hello World!
