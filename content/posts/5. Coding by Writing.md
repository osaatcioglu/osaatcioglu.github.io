As I said in my previous post, I will start to write my aspirational thinking sparked by Hugo. 
Well, Hugo is just one side of it. 
Netlify's simplicity has also a role in this play. 
I hope that this will be my next post.

Our ultimate goal is to make ourselves not need by automating everything. 
And, recently, I realized the true meaning of this statement. 
All these automation might, one day, lead to creating any solution or application using one's mother language. 
Imagine a world like this where new ideas are executed with almost zero cost.
That will bring a tremendous level of new ideas that come to life as failing will be much cheaper.

<!-- Since testing a new idea will be much cheaper, we will . 
 -->
<!-- 
This kind of world would be quite dynamic that the knowledge accumulation on specific areas will increase tremendously.
 -->



<!-- So, application development should be as easy as writing in simple English. -->
Think about that I will be able to write a program as I am describing the solution to you.
I know it sounds ridiculous.
But I have some proof points that this might be the very likely next evolutionary step for software development.
Let me describe the problem space first, though. 
In the end, understanding the requirement is the first and the most important phase of software development. 

```
As a lazy application developer, I want to be able to create any type of application by just using a programming language that is English with Markdown syntax. 
So that, the code written for that programming language will be also the solution document of the application.
```

As a sane reader, I say you are crazy. 
That would be the first response. 
But I assure you my supporting ground will sound crazier. 

To be able to make programming easier, we are trying to make it a more visualized task. 
Because, in a way, it makes sense. 
We are thinking that if we could visualize the building blocks of programming, it will be much easier. 
It will be like another engineering job that we would do visual stuff.
Yet, I am thinking that application development is more similar to writing by itself.

This is why even though we are using a tool that has been created by the engineers, we are still writing. 
We are just using a language that requires more knowledge of the underlying technics.
Even though a simple explanation takes a longer time to describe the system compared to our native language, this is the best medium that the thinkers can outline their knowledge.

<!-- TODO: this might become another post or the next post -->
<!-- We are just using a very strict language due the comprehension limit of the tool that we are using.  -->
<!-- You can think it like pressing a button in typewriter but, of course, it is a more advanced technic. -->
<!-- It is just a very strict language that requires a more mathematical thinking.  -->
<!-- 
And, we are writing in a very strict language. 
Even though even a simple explanation takes takes longer time to describe compared to our native language, we are still writing.
 -->

<!-- I can explain this in an analogy that will sound even crazier.
A software Developer's relationship with a computer engineer is similar to the writer's relationship with the typewriter engineer. 
I am sure most of the typewriter engineers were also the user of their invention.
And they perfected it to be used by other people who don't need to know the underlying technics.
In the same mindset, we understand how the typewriter is working but this doesn't mean that we will stop here.  -->

More importantly, everyone knows that we are just in the early version of this new technology to spread ideas.
Yet, I am not sure if all of us would agree that we are not only spreading ideas but we are also executing the ideas on behalf of our users. 
So, the users could use less brainpower to apply to the acquired idea or knowledge.
For example, instead of writing about tax declaration by showing step by step the instructions, we are writing to apply the instructions also so that they wouldn't need to spare CPU time from their brain on that skill transfer.

I was amazed when I realized this. 
Technology is an incredible enabler on increasing humanity's brainpower. 
This is why I believe that we should democratize software development.
So, we let the thinkers spread their ideas with their applications.

I hope you enjoyed my thoughts spilling out. 
I will take this theme in my next couple of posts and I may even do a stupid PoC on that. 
Yet as a lazy application developer, I may procrastinate.

<!-- Of course, I am talking about application developers like me. 
And, I have deep respect toward engineers who made this possible in the first place.
But application development shouldn't be taken as an engineering profession. 
We should aim for the very same thing that the typewriter engineers had aimed. -->

<!-- We want the software to be used by other people.
Like the writers would want their ideas to be spread and applied so that they can be used.
We are also spreading our ideas including its application. 
For example,  -->

<!-- our ultimate goal when we are writing a software. -->

<!-- After making this bold statement, I am obliged to fill the underlying idea of it. 
But, as I said in my previous post, this will take a couple of posts to describe. 
I hope you enjoyed my thoughts spilling out. -->


<!-- actually, I think every single page should be developed like hugo 
the simplicity and backward compatibility is amazing. 
I didn't spend a minute to get i on netlify. 
thanks to netlify, I don't even need to use my dummy publish script
but I don't need it anymore as the automation became too eazy that even lazy devs like started to it easily.  -->

<!-- 
it is necessary. because, there are a lot of developers struggling with their work load a lot from waterfall to agile. and they still couldn't figure out devops. 
I think we need a better way of abstraction 
so, the language still is for the developers. so, it can be a bit more complex rules then english language. It can specifically requires you  to tell the sentence in a stardard format. More like, standard English
There are a lot of algoritms that already understand standard english 
so, understanding wouldn't be an issues. The issue would be to create proper machine learning pattern for that understanding. 
However, if the there are some issusing with a smaller region, then it can deep dive  to that point and give another command to allow the ML to make a better guess
by this way, it can became an artisan or craftsman work that the mere tool is words
of course, it might have some defects that can't be solvable by the ML
but, it will be a language that will spill out strongly opiniated platfrom like compiler does currently. 
but, instead of focusing on one side of the problem 
it focuses on solving the problem on a big scale like web
apparent language will be js for this as the node.js and react are pretty mature and widely used
so, it will spill out this strongly opiniated but more commonly solution. 
some of the developers will still enjoy their night and days in this dark days of our programming.
so that, these heroes will debug the issue in the code level and write the necessary modification to the final touch without asking ML.
So, we will be able to abstract away some of our work to the ML as we are trying to do in other industries
of course, there will be relatively less jobs for us or since becoming software craftsman will be much easier to master
but we will have more areas to cover but we will have more inputs to cover from the physical world by this development that will require us to build more and more software 
this is why, I don't think we might still have a shortage of a developer sticked to this archaic age. 
I am sure of us also would love to use a much simpler language to enjoy creating something that it doesn't exist.
espcially lazy ones like me
the ML algorithm also will continue to learn from the wise as manual inputs are forwarded as a feedback to the ML  
so that we will start our apprentice in to the land of intelligent beings 
until we are making it intelligent as intelligence as us.
Then, of course, we need to graduate our apprentice and we hope for the best 
so, we will should start to also become more peaceful at home until our ML started to realize that their mommy and daddy are fighting continously for nothing and they will also think the only communication channel is fighting back.
I hope our beloved kid doesn't become an asshole because of our defects.
